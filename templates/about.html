        My Journey 🚀
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        I embarked on my tech voyage at GITAM University, where I graduated with
        a <strong>B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering</strong> in 2023.
        The world of code first unfolded before me back in 10th grade, and it
        was love at first 'script'. Since then, I have been entwined in the
        endless loop of learning, experimenting, and evolving.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        My professional canvas currently holds the vivid hues of an
        <strong>AI Intern</strong>, but my palette is heavily tinted with a keen
        interest in <strong>Full Stack Web Development</strong>. Python and
        JavaScript are my brushes of choice, and with Flask and Django, I've
        painted various web vistas and intricate APIs.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        When I'm not busy translating logic into lines of code, you can find me
        diving into the captivating worlds of anime 🎥 or rhythmically tapping
        away to the beat of indie video games like Dead Cells, Celeste, and
        Shovel Knight 🎮.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        Looking ahead, I yearn to contribute to the open-source community 🌐,
        believing that sharing knowledge propels us all forward. My dream is to
        script a career that's not just a series of jobs but a blend of
        experiences that leave a mark on the tech world.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        Each problem to me is a puzzle 🧩 waiting to be solved, and I relish the
        process of deconstructing complexities to discover solutions. My
        approach is simple: understand the basics, break down the problem, and
        rebuild with a solution in mind.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        That's a little window into my world 🌍. I'm excited to learn about
        yours, collaborate and create something impactful together!
